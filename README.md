# blockchain rps (rock-paper-scissors)
Simple rock-paper-scissors game but with blockchain implementation.

1. How I see it working
  1) Player1 chooses a move rock/paper/scissors.
  2) Player1 types his eth-wallet address (login with Metamask).
  3) Player1 types eth-wallet address of the opponent.
  4) Player1 makes a bet.
  5) Player1 presses the "Play" button.
  6) Player2 does points 1-5.
  7) If opponents eth-wallets of Player1 and Player2 match then the game is proceeded.
  8) 3 results are possible - P1-win (bets go to P1) / P2-win (bets go to P2) / Draw (bets withdraw)
  
  2. What is done
    For now the frontend part is practically ready, there are some issues with Moves-carousel and with layout in general.
    
  3. What is to be done
    Currently I am working on the development of the smart-contract.
